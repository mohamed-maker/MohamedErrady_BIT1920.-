Normalise this data up to 3NF, taking in to account these constraints:

    Each personnel number is unique
    Each lab has a single lab code
    Each research project has a single code and supervisor
    Each member of the personnel may work on one or more research projects (many to many relationship) 
    Personnel names need not necessarily be unique
  ==>   Research code, description and supervisor are repeating fields
